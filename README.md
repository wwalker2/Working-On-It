# Working-On-It

This is an Android application designed for contract workers to help manage their clients.

With it, contractors can easily inform clients on their status on contracts whether they will be late or not. The client will recieve the message as a text message.

There is also a calander where the contractor can see which client they have to work with next. The contactor can select days of the week to be their days off, and the calendar will avoid posting jobs on those days.

If a contractor has a superior, that person can add clients to their calander. The app will then search the contractor's calander to find a perfect spot to place it.

For each client on the calendar, the contractor can see what they are doing that day and the tools they'll need to bring for that particular job.

There will also be a seperate list of all the clients the contractor is currently working with and contains details such as total cost for the job, name of client, job location, and wether or not the client has paid.
