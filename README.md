# Working-On-It

This is an Android application designed for contract workers to help manage their clients.
With it contractors can easily inform clients on their status on contracts whether they will be late or not.
There is also a calander where the contractor can see which client they are working with next.
If a contractor has a superior, that person can add clients to their calander.
For each client on the calendar, the contractor can see the tools they'll need for that particular job.
